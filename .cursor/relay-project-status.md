# Relay Project Status

> **What Relay has shipped, what is in progress, and where it is headed.**
> **Last updated:** 2026-06-04 (status.podName selection semantics)
>
> For **how agents should implement tasks** (scope rules, templates, scans, updating this file), see [`.cursor/relay-cursor-workflow.md`](relay-cursor-workflow.md).

The **roadmap** below is long-term product intent, not a single backlog. **Ready for Cursor Queue** lists the next small implementation slices.

---

## Ready for Cursor Queue

Pick **one task card** per session unless the user asks for a design plan. Implementation rules: [`.cursor/relay-cursor-workflow.md`](relay-cursor-workflow.md).

_(Queue empty — promote a task from **Discovered Follow-Up Tasks** or Phase 1 roadmap when ready.)_

**Recently completed** (do not re-implement unless regressions): **status.podName selection semantics** (documented + tie-break; unit tests for retries/stale Job UID), **AgentSession finalizers** (`relay.secureai.dev/finalizer`, owned Job delete on session delete, `blockOwnerDeletion=false` on Jobs), **envtest delete-path coverage**, **GitHub Actions** (`test.yaml`, `e2e.yaml`, `lint.yaml`), **session cancellation** (full stack + README + cancel sample), **terminal phase stability**, envtest controller suite, `promptConfigMapRef`, status patch strategy, **`status.podName`**, cancellation e2e.

---

## Discovered Follow-Up Tasks

Scoped tasks found by repository audit or implementation work. **Not in the active queue** until promoted. Pick one at a time into **Ready for Cursor Queue** when appropriate.

### Task: Watch owned Pods for reconcile triggers

**Why it matters:**  
`status.podName` and Running transitions currently depend on Job reconcile and `RequeueAfter`; watching Pods reduces latency and unnecessary requeues.

**Scope:**
- Register a controller-runtime watch on Pods owned by session Jobs (label or owner reference filter).
- Map Pod events to AgentSession reconcile requests.
- Keep RBAC markers aligned (`pods` get/list/watch already granted).

**Non-goals:**
- Do not implement log/artifact collection.
- Do not add a new CRD or UI.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Pod creation/update triggers AgentSession reconcile without relying solely on `RequeueAfter`.
- Envtest or integration test demonstrates earlier `status.podName` population where practical.

**Expected files:**
- `internal/controller/agentsession_controller.go`
- `config/rbac/role.yaml` (generated, only if markers change)

**Verification command:**  
`make test`

### Task: Define reference scoping rules for external refs

**Why it matters:**  
`promptConfigMapRef` only loads ConfigMaps in the same namespace; policy, credentials, and templates will need documented scoping before cross-namespace support.

**Scope:**
- Document same-namespace requirement for `promptConfigMapRef` in API comments and README.
- Add a short design note in this file for future refs (AgentPolicy, CredentialProfile, SessionTemplate): same-namespace default, optional explicit namespace field later.

**Non-goals:**
- Do not implement cross-namespace ConfigMap reads.
- Do not add new CRDs.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- API/kubebuilder comments and README state current scoping rules.
- Status file records the intended future pattern for namespaced refs.

**Expected files:**
- `api/v1alpha1/agentsession_types.go`
- `README.md`
- `.cursor/relay-project-status.md`

**Verification command:**  
`make manifests && make test`

### Task: Validate sample manifests against current CRD

**Why it matters:**  
Samples are hand-maintained; drift from generated CRD fields breaks copy-paste onboarding.

**Scope:**
- Verify `config/samples/*.yaml` apply cleanly after `make install` on kind.
- Fix invalid fields, document `cancelRequested` sample once cancellation is complete.
- Optionally add a Makefile target or script that dry-runs `kubectl apply --dry-run=server` on samples.

**Non-goals:**
- Do not change CRD schema unless samples expose a real bug.
- Do not add Helm.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- All samples pass server-side dry-run (or apply) against the installed CRD.
- README sample instructions match the validated manifests.

**Expected files:**
- `config/samples/*.yaml`
- `Makefile` or `hack/` script (only if a verify target is added)
- `README.md`

**Verification command:**  
`make install` (on kind) and sample apply/dry-run

### Task: Document future-only status fields

**Why it matters:**  
`status.usage`, `status.violations`, and `status.artifacts` exist in the API but are not populated; operators should not expect them in MVP.

**Scope:**
- Add kubebuilder/API comments marking fields as reserved for future phases.
- Add a README table: field → populated? → which phase owns it.

**Non-goals:**
- Do not implement sidecars, enforcement, or artifact collection.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- CRD OpenAPI descriptions state MVP population status.
- README lists future-only status fields explicitly.

**Expected files:**
- `api/v1alpha1/agentsession_types.go`
- `config/crd/bases/relay.secureai.dev_agentsessions.yaml` (generated)
- `README.md`

**Verification command:**  
`make manifests && make test`

### Task: Add e2e for TimedOut session

**Why it matters:**  
Controller maps `activeDeadlineSeconds` to `PhaseTimedOut`, but e2e only covers Succeeded, Failed, and Denied paths.

**Scope:**
- Add kind e2e with a short `timeoutSeconds` and a sleep command that exceeds it.
- Assert `status.phase=TimedOut` and terminal condition.

**Non-goals:**
- Do not change timeout logic unless the e2e exposes a bug.
- Do not add cancellation or finalizer coverage in this task.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- `make test-e2e` includes a TimedOut spec that passes reliably on kind.

**Expected files:**
- `test/e2e/agentsession_test.go`
- `test/e2e/helpers_test.go` (only if needed)

**Verification command:**  
`make test-e2e`

### Task: Document Kubernetes Events emitted by the controller

**Why it matters:**  
Events are the primary MVP observability surface; operators need a stable catalog before Phase 4 structured events.

**Scope:**
- Document `EventReason*` constants and when each fires (validation, Job create, running, success, failure, denial, cancellation once added).
- Cross-link to README “inspect events” section.

**Non-goals:**
- Do not add OTLP, audit sinks, or UI.
- Do not change event text unless incorrect.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- README (or `docs/`) lists all current event reasons and types (Normal/Warning).

**Expected files:**
- `README.md`
- `internal/controller/constants.go` (comments only, if helpful)

**Verification command:**  
`make test` (no behavior change; docs-only)

### Task: Audit controller RBAC for least privilege

**Why it matters:**  
RBAC must match kubebuilder markers and actual client calls (Jobs delete, ConfigMaps get, Events create, status update).

**Scope:**
- Compare `+kubebuilder:rbac` markers in `agentsession_controller.go` to `config/rbac/role.yaml`.
- Remove unused verbs/resources; add missing ones.
- Note any permissions reserved for future controllers.

**Non-goals:**
- Do not add RBAC for unimplemented CRDs.
- Do not deploy OPA or admission policies.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- `make manifests` regenerates role YAML consistent with markers.
- Short permission matrix in README or this file.

**Expected files:**
- `internal/controller/agentsession_controller.go`
- `config/rbac/role.yaml` (generated)

**Verification command:**  
`make manifests && make test`

### Task: Update README current-state section

**Why it matters:**  
README mixes vision and MVP reality; `cancelRequested`, declared-vs-enforced policy, and unimplemented `outputs` should be obvious.

**Scope:**
- Add/update a “Current MVP behavior” section aligned with **What works today** and **Known gaps** here.
- Document `spec.cancelRequested` once cancellation status/events are done.
- Clarify env vars are propagation hooks, not enforcement.

**Non-goals:**
- Do not document unimplemented features as shipped.
- Do not add UI or enforcement guides.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- README accurately reflects controller behavior and explicit non-goals.
- Cancellation and policy sections match the status file.

**Expected files:**
- `README.md`
- `.cursor/relay-project-status.md`

**Verification command:**  
`make test` (docs-only)

### Task: Pin dev tool versions in README

**Why it matters:**  
`Makefile` pins `controller-gen` and `setup-envtest`; README should match to avoid Go/envtest version skew.

**Scope:**
- Document pinned `controller-gen`, `setup-envtest`, and kindest node image versions from Makefile / devcontainer.
- Mention `ENVTEST_K8S_VERSION` expectation.

**Non-goals:**
- Do not upgrade tool versions unless broken.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- README dev-setup section lists the same versions as Makefile/devcontainer.

**Expected files:**
- `README.md`

**Verification command:**  
`make test` (docs-only)

## Current Operational State

Relay is in **early MVP / vertical-slice** stage. The core control-plane loop works end-to-end on a local kind cluster, but most governance is **declared and propagated**, not **enforced**.

| Area | State | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| **AgentSession CRD** | Done | `relay.secureai.dev/v1alpha1`, full spec/status schema |
| **Controller (kubernetes-job)** | Done | Reconciles to `batch/v1` Job, lifecycle phases, conditions, events |
| **Policy propagation** | Done | Inline policy → env vars in agent container |
| **Policy enforcement** | Not started | Env vars are hooks only; no network/tool/file gates |
| **Dev environment** | Done | Devcontainer + kind (`relay-dev`) + bootstrap scripts |
| **E2E tests** | Done | `make test-e2e` — 10 specs against live kind cluster |
| **Unit / envtest** | Done | Controller suite with validation + reconciler specs (~65% coverage) |
| **CI** | Not started | No `.github/workflows` |
| **In-cluster deploy** | Ready | `make dev-deploy` builds image + deploys manager |
| **Additional CRDs** | Not started | AgentPolicy, ToolPolicy, ApprovalPolicy, etc. |
| **Operational UI** | Not started | Vision documented in product rule |
| **Audit / observability backend** | Not started | Status fields exist; not populated by sidecars yet |

### What works today

- Create `AgentSession` → controller validates → creates owned Job → tracks `Pending` → `Starting` → `Running` → `Succeeded` / `Failed` / `TimedOut` / `Denied` / `Cancelled`
- CRD admission rejects invalid `temperature` (string + Pattern)
- Controller validation denies bad specs (e.g. empty task) without creating a Job
- `task.promptConfigMapRef` loads prompt from ConfigMap into `AGENT_TASK_PROMPT`
- Policy fields injected as `AGENT_POLICY_*` / `RELAY_*` env vars
- Workspace emptyDir mount, resource limits, timeout, basic container hardening
- Kubernetes Events on validation, Job create, running, success, failure, cancellation
- `spec.cancelRequested: true` deletes the owned Job and reaches terminal `PhaseCancelled` with `Completed` condition
- `status.podName` set to the newest Pod owned by the session's Job (when a Pod exists)
- Sample manifests (success + failing) and README documentation

### Known gaps (MVP vs schema)

| Capability | In API/schema | Implemented in controller |
|------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| `task.promptConfigMapRef` | Yes | Done — loads key from same-namespace ConfigMap |
| `status.usage` | Yes | No — reserved for future sidecar/audit |
| `status.podName` | Yes | Done — labeled session Pods, current Job UID, newest `CreationTimestamp` (name tie-break); see `internal/controller/pod.go` |
| `status.violations` | Yes | No — no enforcement backend yet |
| `status.artifacts` | Yes | No — `outputs.collectArtifacts` not implemented |
| `policy.requireHumanApproval` | Yes | Surfaced only; does not block execution |
| `spec.cancelRequested` | Yes | Done — deletes Job; sets `PhaseCancelled`, condition, event |
| `PhaseCancelled` | Yes | Done — terminal via cancel reconcile path |
| Terminal session + missing Job | — | Done — terminal phases skip `ensureJob`; `syncStatusFromJob` does not regress phase |
| AgentSession delete | — | Done — finalizer blocks delete; owned Job removed; finalizer cleared |
| Orchestrators beyond `kubernetes-job` | Enum reserved | Rejected at validation |
| PVC-backed workspace | Commented future | emptyDir only |
| Webhook validation | Generated scaffold | Not wired |

### status.podName selection semantics

Documented in `internal/controller/pod.go` and API comments on `status.podName`:

- List Pods in the session namespace with `relay.secureai.dev/session=<session.name>`.
- Keep only Pods whose `ownerReference` matches the **current** Job UID (`Kind=Job`).
- Select the newest by `CreationTimestamp`; ties break on lexicographic Pod name.
- Empty when no match yet. Stale Pods from a replaced Job (new UID) are ignored.

### Recent fixes

- **status.podName selection semantics** — documented retry/recreate behavior; deterministic name tie-break; unit tests for stale Job UID and equal timestamps
- **AgentSession finalizers** — `AgentSessionFinalizer` attached on reconcile; `handleDeletion` deletes owned Job (clears `blockOwnerDeletion` when needed), removes finalizer; uncached `APIReader` for delete detection; envtest delete-path specs
- **GitHub Actions CI** — `.github/workflows/test.yaml` (`make test`), `e2e.yaml` (kind + `make test-e2e`), `lint.yaml` (`make fmt` + `make vet`)
- **Terminal phase stability** — terminal sessions do not get a replacement Job; `syncStatusFromJob` preserves terminal phase; envtest coverage
- **Cancellation docs** — README cancel section, MVP table, `relay_v1alpha1_agentsession_cancel.yaml` sample
- **Cancellation e2e** — cancel running session → Job deleted + `PhaseCancelled`; cancel at create → no Job
- **Session cancellation (status/events)** — `applyCancellationStatus`: `PhaseCancelled`, `Completed`/`SessionCancelled`, result outcome `cancelled`, `SessionCancelled` event; envtest coverage
- **Session cancellation (controller)** — `spec.cancelRequested` deletes owned Job via `stopRuntimeJob`; envtest for delete + idempotent missing Job
- **`spec.cancelRequested`** — declarative cancellation request on `AgentSessionSpec`; CRD default `false`
- **`status.podName`** — select newest Pod owned by the Job; list errors fail reconcile; envtest + e2e coverage on success/failure paths
- **Envtest controller tests** — validation, denial, Job create, succeeded transition, promptConfigMapRef
- **PromptConfigMapRef** — `resolveTask` loads prompt; missing CM/key → `PhaseDenied`
- **Status patch strategy** — `patchStatus` unions conditions from reconcile snapshot + live object before update; avoids JSON merge patch array replacement on CRDs
- **RuntimeCreated condition race** — re-assert condition on every `ensureJob` to survive stale-cache JSON-merge-patch overwrites (found by e2e happy-path test)
- **Model temperature** — `*string` with CRD Pattern instead of `float64` / `allowDangerousTypes`
- **Devcontainer** — Docker-outside-of-Docker + resilient `kind-up.sh`

## Roadmap

Status key: `[ ]` not started · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done · `[-]` deferred

Phases are ordered by product maturity. **Implement incrementally** — decompose per [`.cursor/relay-cursor-workflow.md`](relay-cursor-workflow.md), not as a single effort.

---

### Phase 0 — MVP foundation (mostly complete)

- [x] AgentSession CRD + kubebuilder scaffold
- [x] Reconcile to Kubernetes Job with owner references
- [x] Lifecycle phases, conditions (`Validated`, `RuntimeCreated`, `Completed`), events
- [x] Inline policy spec + env var propagation
- [x] Workspace emptyDir, resources, timeout, security context baseline
- [x] Sample manifests + README
- [x] Devcontainer + kind local cluster
- [x] E2E test suite (`make test-e2e`)

---

### Phase 1 — MVP hardening

Complete the vertical slice so the API and controller behavior match, and the project is safe to extend.

- [x] **Envtest controller tests** — Reconciler unit tests in `internal/controller/` (validation, Job create, status transitions, condition stability)
- [x] **PromptConfigMapRef** — Load prompt from ConfigMap in reconciler; validate ref exists
- [x] **Status patch strategy** — Live read + condition union + `Status().Update` (CRDs do not support strategic merge patch on status)
- [x] **Populate `status.podName` reliably** — Newest Job-owned Pod by creation timestamp; envtest + e2e coverage
- [x] **Session cancellation** — API, Job delete, `PhaseCancelled`, events, e2e, README + sample
- [x] **Finalizers** — `relay.secureai.dev/finalizer`; owned Job cleanup on delete; envtest coverage
- [~] **CI pipeline** — GitHub Actions: `make test`, `make test-e2e` (kind), lint (`test`/`e2e`/`lint` workflows); image build/publish not yet in CI
- [ ] **Admission webhook** (optional) — Move duplicate validation to validating webhook for earlier rejection
- [ ] **Helm chart or improved kustomize overlays** — Easier install than raw kustomize for early adopters
- [x] **Terminal phase stability** — Terminal phases skip Job creation; `syncStatusFromJob` does not regress phase; envtest
- [ ] **Reference scoping documentation** — Same-namespace rules for ConfigMap/policy/credential refs
- [ ] **E2e TimedOut path** — Prove `activeDeadlineSeconds` → `PhaseTimedOut` on kind

---

### Phase 2 — Reusable policy model

Extract inline policy into composable, versioned CRDs without breaking AgentSession.

- [ ] **AgentPolicy CRD** — Reusable network/tool/file/approval rules; reference from AgentSession
- [ ] **Policy composition** — Merge order: AgentPolicy → session inline overrides; record matched policies in status
- [ ] **Policy modes** — `audit-only`, `dry-run`, `enforced` (declared vs enforced distinction)
- [ ] **Policy decision records** — Structured status entries: who/what/when/allow/deny/reason
- [ ] **ToolPolicy CRD** — Tool/MCP allowlists, rate limits, argument constraints
- [ ] **RuntimeProfile CRD** — Stricter security contexts, sandbox selection, sidecar profiles

---

### Phase 3 — Data-plane enforcement

Real governance beyond env var propagation. Start narrow, prove value, then expand.

- [ ] **Enforcement architecture** — Define control-plane vs data-plane interfaces (sidecar, gateway, eBPF agent contracts)
- [ ] **NetworkPolicy baseline** — Auto-generate namespace-scoped NetworkPolicy from session policy (CIDR/domain hints)
- [ ] **DNS / egress proxy** — FQDN allow/deny enforcement (Envoy or dedicated DNS proxy sidecar)
- [ ] **Envoy sidecar injection** — Optional per-session sidecar via RuntimeProfile; egress filter config from policy
- [ ] **Tool gateway integration** — Route tool/MCP calls through governed gateway; log + enforce
- [ ] **Violation reporting** — Populate `status.violations` from enforcement backends in real time
- [ ] **File/workspace policy** — Read/write path restrictions (volume mounts, seccomp, or FS proxy)

---

### Phase 4 — Observability and audit

Backend surfaces for the future operational UI and enterprise audit requirements.

- [ ] **Structured session events API** — Timestamped event stream beyond Kubernetes Events (tool call, network, policy decision)
- [ ] **Session timeline model** — Normalized events suitable for UI timeline view
- [ ] **Audit log sink** — Export to OTLP, S3, or SIEM-compatible format
- [ ] **Usage metrics** — Populate `status.usage` (tokens, tool calls, network requests) from sidecar/agent reports
- [ ] **OpenTelemetry** — Traces for reconcile loop + optional agent runtime traces
- [ ] **Prometheus metrics** — Sessions by phase, violations, approval queue depth, reconcile latency
- [ ] **Log / artifact collection** — Implement `outputs.collectLogs` / `collectArtifacts`

---

### Phase 5 — Human approval workflows

Scoped, auditable gates — not a boolean env var.

- [ ] **ApprovalPolicy CRD** — Define what actions require approval
- [ ] **ApprovalRequest CRD** — Per-action approval objects (tool, domain, file write, deploy, credential use)
- [ ] **Controller approval gate** — Block execution until approved; resume on approval
- [ ] **Approval audit trail** — Who approved, when, scope, expiry
- [ ] **Integration hooks** — Slack, PagerDuty, or generic webhook for approval notifications

---

### Phase 6 — Orchestrator adapters

Stay orchestrator-agnostic; add backends without coupling core reconciler to Jobs.

- [ ] **Orchestrator interface** — `CreateRuntime`, `GetStatus`, `Cancel` abstraction in controller
- [ ] **Tekton adapter** — `runtime.orchestrator: tekton`
- [ ] **Argo Workflows adapter**
- [ ] **Temporal adapter** (or external worker handshake)
- [ ] **SessionTemplate CRD** — Parameterized session blueprints for platform teams

---

### Phase 7 — Operational UI

Governance/observability dashboard — not a chatbot.

- [ ] **UI architecture** — SPA + backend API reading CRDs, events, audit store
- [ ] **Session list / detail** — Phase, Job, policy summary, conditions, violations
- [ ] **Session timeline view** — Tool, network, policy events chronologically
- [ ] **Live policy / network view** — Active connections, blocks, violations (requires Phase 3–4)
- [ ] **Tool governance view** — Allowed/denied tools, call history
- [ ] **Approval inbox** — Pending approvals with approve/deny actions
- [ ] **Runtime topology view** — Agent → gateway → sidecar → APIs graph
- [ ] **Audit / forensics** — Replay, traces, historical search

---

### Phase 8 — Enterprise platform

Multi-tenant, identity, credentials — production-grade control plane.

- [ ] **Per-session identity** — Dedicated ServiceAccount provisioning, RBAC scoping
- [ ] **CredentialProfile CRD** — Scoped secrets/KMS references; no broad secret mounts
- [ ] **Multi-tenancy** — Namespace isolation patterns, quota, policy boundaries
- [ ] **High availability** — Leader election (scaffold exists), multiple replicas, graceful shutdown
- [ ] **Multi-cluster** — Fleet-level policy and session visibility (future)
- [ ] **Secure sandboxes** — gVisor/Kata/Firecracker via RuntimeProfile

---
